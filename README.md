The project encompasses various frames interconnected in a structured manner:

1. **Login Page**: Users are required to authenticate themselves through this page to access the system's functionalities securely.

2. **Registration Page**: New users can sign up for access to the library system by providing necessary information.

3. **Home Page**: Upon successful login, users are directed to the home page, serving as a central hub for navigating through different features and functionalities. The home page further branches out to the following frames:

   - **Add Book**: Allows librarians to input details of new books to be added to the library's collection.
   
   - **Delete Book**: Provides functionality to remove books from the library's inventory.
   
   - **View Books**: Enables users to browse through the library's collection and access information about available books.
   
   - **Issue Book**: Facilitates the process of lending books to library members, managing borrowing transactions efficiently.
   
   - **Return Book**: Allows users to return borrowed books, updating the system's records accordingly.
   
   - **Defaulters**: Provides librarians with insights into overdue book returns and manages penalties or notifications for defaulting users.

By structuring the system in this manner, users can seamlessly navigate through different operations, enhancing the overall management of library resources and services.
